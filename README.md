=================

1. [25	marks]	 Convert	everything	to	use	GLSL	for	the	rendering,	including	geometry,	
lighting	and	textures.
2. [10	marks]	 Add	an	option	to	switch	between	“daytime”	and	“nighttime”	modes.
3. [10	marks]	 Add	the	option	to	use	a	flashlight.	You	can	either	try	using	an	OpenGL	
spotlight,	or	find	another	way	to	simulate	a	flashlight.
4. [5	marks]	 Add	the	option	to	turn	fog	on	or	off.	The	user	should	be	able	to	select	the	
fog	function	and	the	relevant	parameters,	either	by	specifying	them	as	command	line	
arguments	to	your	program,	or	some	other	user	interface.
5. [15	marks]	 If	the	user	presses	the	‘c’	key,	a	translucent	console	should	appear,	showing	
a	2-D	map	of	the	maze,	and	the	user’s	current	location	and	orientation.
6. [15	marks]	 Place	rotating	text	in	the	centre	of	the	maze,	above	the	user’s	view.	That	is,	
by	looking	up	(using	the	PageUp	key),	the	user	should	see	some	text	rotating	about	the	
y-axis,	as	in	the	example	given	in	the	3D	text	lab.	The	text	should	say	“BCIT	Games	
Development	Option”.	You	can	set	a	constant,	reasonable	rotation	speed.
Submit	your	entire	project,	including	documentation	(at	least	a	README	file	with	any	notes	
and	a	description	of	the	user	controls	for	each	part)	to	the	D2L	dropbox.	You	are	to	work	
in	groups	of	two	or	three	and	all	will	receive	the	same	mark.	Your	submission	should	be	
in	a	single	ZIP	file	using	the	naming	convention	A00ABC_A00XYZ_Asst4.zip	or	A00ABC_
A00DEF_A00XYZ_Asst4.zip,	where	ABC,	DEF	and	XYZ	are	your	student	numbers.	Only	
one	of	you	needs	to	submit	to	the	dropbox.
